## The Algorithm

This project was developed using Jetson Nano. It is a retrained resnet18 model whose dataset consists of many instruments, each labelled by their instrument family's name. When it is run, it uses the imagenet.py program with the model to determine the instrument family of an inputted image.  
Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here.
